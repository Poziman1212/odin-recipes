    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        We have a specialty in Japan known as <strong>Tonkatsu</strong> (とんかつ, 豚かつ) or deep-fried pork cutlet. This Western-inspired dish
        has been enjoyed for over 120 years, with the recipe remaining mostly unchanged since then. So, what makes
        Tonkatsu special, and how can we make this popular dish at home? Believe it or not, making Japanese pork cutlet
        at home is easier than you think. It should take no more than 30 minutes!
